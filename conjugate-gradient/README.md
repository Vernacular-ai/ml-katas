# Conjugate Gradient Method

## What goes here?

Conjugate gradient solver, linear and non-linear one. One of the main ideas is
to notice the trade-offs and other practicalities, therefore we might need to
implement a few baselines too.

## Environment

Datasets that cover all the important properties of CG should be helpful. For
example, we can take a simple quadratic problem, a _large_ quadratic problem, a
non-linear problem etc.

Interesting things to look for include memory and compute requirements, number
of iterations vs error etc.

[Numerical Optimization](https://www.springer.com/in/book/9780387303031) by J.
Nocedal and S. Wright should cover almost all of what is needed here.

others, An introduction to the conjugate gradient method without the agonizing
pain
