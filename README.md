Katas for Machine Learning.

## Template for new kata

Pick a topic, create an _exercise_ using the following suggested template
(subject to change):

1. what will we get to learn at the end of this exercise?
2. how is your environment going to look like
  - datasets you are working with
  - ~tools, languages etc~ since people might want to try different things here, this information can go in the solution readmes
3. reference documents, papers, baselines etc.

Work on the solution and keep pushing in this repo. The directory structure can
look like this:

```
README.md  # this readme
<some-problem>
  README.md  # problem specification
  <solution-dir-1>  # someone's solution
  <solution-dir-2>  # someone else's solution
```
