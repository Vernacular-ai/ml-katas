# Limited-memory BFGS

## What goes here?

An implementation of limited memory version of the
Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) optimization algorithm. At the end of
the exercise, we aim to learn the general shape of second order methods, BFGS
itself, and the tricks used for approximating it using less memory.

## Environment

A small dataset like MNIST and simple models like single layer neural nets can
help diagnose and validate the implementation.

Nocedal and S. Wright should cover almost all of what is needed here.
